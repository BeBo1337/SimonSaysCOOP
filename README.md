# Cooperative Simon Says Game

This project is a digital implementation of the classic memory game called "Simon Game." It tests your memory and pattern recognition skills by challenging you to repeat a sequence of randomly generated colors and sounds.

# Game Description

A memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts with a single random color/sound, and the player must reproduce the sequence correctly. After each successful round, the game adds one more color/sound to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging.

The game continues until the player makes a mistake by failing to repeat the correct sequence. At that point, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
